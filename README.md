Small server/client which moves file at the end of a download in qBittorrent. It allows files to be move into the right folder.

## How to use
- Launch the server on the computer which runs qBittorrent
- Send command with client.py to the server.py
- Tell to qBittorrent to send move function to the server when the download is done

## Examples
+ Add a moving scheme : `python client.py add "d:/anime/" "Ore Monogatari"`
+ Remove a moving scheme : `python client.py remove "Ore Monogatari`
+ Move a file : `python client.py move "d:/downloads/[FanSub]Ore Monogatari EP07[720p].mkv" "[FanSub]Ore Monogatari EP07[720p].mkv"`

This last command line is generated by qBittorrent, you just have to add this line :
+ `python d:/client.py move "%f" "%n"`

The client must have its complete path because qBittorrent is running the command line in its own directory. `%f` stands for the torrent path and `%n` for the filename which is contained in the torrent path yes.

## Troubleshooting
+ My command line isn't launched when the downloading is done, what can I do ?

Be sure to have Python in your `PATH`. The code is Python 3.4 compliant, I didn't test it on other versions

+ Is it working for Linux ?

Of course, that's why I did it with Python, it also work on Linux ;)

+ The client cannot connect to the server.

Be sure to set the variable `IP` and `PORT` before use it.
